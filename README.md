# SaltyBotSQL

SaltyBotSQL is a python program developed to monitor the IRC chat of the SaltyBet, Saltybet.com, twitch stream and record the results of the fights. The fights are recorded to a SQL database using sqlite3 and are put into a table with fighter1,fighter2, bet1, bet2, and the winner's name. This data can be used by SaltyBotClient to pull up any recorded statistics on the current fighters.
